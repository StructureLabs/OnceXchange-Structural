### [OnceXchange repository lists (link)](https://github.com/onceXchange/oncex.github.io/wiki/onceXchange (home))

OnceXchange is a collection of searchable lists containing links to user-created GitHub repositories.  The repostories contain open source example files of engineering calculations and models. Example files are text files (not binary) organized by program name i.e. Matlab, SAP2000, OpenSees, Python, RivtCalc etc.  Currently there are about three dozen searchable lists that may be extended and edited by users. Each example repository is released under the GPL3 license, which means it will always remain available as open source.

Each program list includes numbered repository entries, ordered from most recent to oldest.  The repository link is provided in the first line followed by a few lines of example description and key words.  Clicking on the link takes you to the repository where you can further review and download the files.
