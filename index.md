OnceXchange is a set of searchable, user-created GitHub links to repositories with open source, text-based example calculations and models. A wide variety of engineering software programs are covered i.e. Matlab, SAP2000, OpenSees, Python, RivtCalc etc.  Each of the approximately three dozen programs has its own list of searchable links that may be extended and edited by users. Each example is released under a GPL3 license which means that, as it is modified and improved it will remain available as open source.

The program list includes numbered entries, with a link in the first line followed by a few lines of example description with key words e.g.
